Deep breathing exercises and mindfulness are techniques aimed at calming your nervous system and focusing your attention on the present moment, rather than the worries about the future (like your finances) that are keeping you awake. For example, a simple deep breathing exercise involves inhaling slowly and deeply through your nose, holding the breath for a few seconds, and then exhaling slowly through your mouth. This can help lower your heart rate and reduce feelings of anxiety. Mindfulness, on the other hand, is about observing your thoughts and feelings without judgment. It can involve focusing on your breath, body sensations, or sounds around you. Have you tried either of these before?"

Prescribing or recommending medication requires a thorough evaluation by a qualified medical professional, such as a psychiatrist or your primary care physician, who can assess your specific needs and medical history. Medications can have side effects and interactions, so it's really important to have that individual assessment. However, I can certainly share more relaxation techniques that might help you manage anxiety in the moment, such as progressive muscle relaxation or visualization exercises, while you're exploring longer-term solutions with a doctor. Would you like to hear about those?"

These are foundational for managing stress and boosting mood.\n*   **Suggest enjoyable activities:** Activities that bring them joy or a sense of accomplishment can be great distractions and mood-boosters.
